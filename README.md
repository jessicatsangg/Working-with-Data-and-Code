# Animal Treadmill Stimulation
This project is a gamified experience designed to make treadmill workouts more engaging by allowing users to unlock characters as they increase their speed. Built using Processing (Python mode), the game tackles the real-world challenge of maintaining motivation during treadmill sessions. By introducing a fun, reward-based mechanic, users are encouraged to push themselves harder and stay committed to their fitness goals.

## General Information
This project introduces a gamified solution for users who struggle with gym motivation, specifically during treadmill workouts. Users unlock characters as they increase their treadmill speed, making the exercise more engaging and fun.
#### What problem does it intend to solve?
The project addresses the challenge of staying motivated during treadmill workouts by blending exercise with a gaming reward system.
#### Purpose
The goal is to enhance the gym experience by making it more interactive, engaging, and rewarding for users during their treadmill sessions.
#### Why undertake it?
As someone who works at a gym, I’ve seen firsthand how people struggle with motivation on treadmills. This project aims to tackle that issue by offering a fun and interactive solution.
## Technologies Used
* Processing (Python mode) - Version 4.0+
* Python - For coding the logic and user interactions
* PIL (Python Imaging Library) - For sprite and character management
## Features
* Speed-based character unlocking: As users increase their speed, new characters are unlocked.
* Real-time feedback: Visual updates on-screen motivate users to push their limits during treadmill workouts.
* Engaging visuals: Simple, fun characters make the workout more enjoyable.

## Setup

## Usage
1. Launch the game in Processing (Python mode).
2. Users will control the treadmill simulation by adjusting the speed.
3. A speed increases, different characters will unlock and appear on the screen.
4. The aim is to motivate users to push their treadmill speed higher to unlock all characters.

## Project Status
The project is: in progress
The core mechanics for speed-based character unlocking have been implemented. Further refinement and additional features are under development.
## Room for Improvement
Areas to Improve:
* Additional characters: More unlockable characters for different speed milestones.
* Sound effects: Adding audio cues to enhance the user experience.

To Do:
* Add leaderboards to track progress over time.
* Implement different workout modes or challenges for variety.
